How to recreate spike waveform alignment
updated 4/30/24
-----------------------------------------
-> Note: This code was written in Matlab R2022a, and 
makes use of optional toolboxes provided by Mathworks.  
It is not guaranteed to work with earlier Matlab versions. 

(1) Relevant data from monkey G, pre-MPTP are made available 
in the Zenodo repository: 

-> Data to accompany the outlier-waveform-detection 
Github repository
-> DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.11077189

The data are limited to this monkey/MPTP combination due 
to the practical challenges involved in uploading large
files to Zenodo.

(2) To demonstrate waveform alignment, it is sufficient to download one of the files in that Zenodo repository: 

-> GPi_input_data_G_Pre.tar.7z

(3) The downloaded file can be decompressed and extracted
from the tar.7z archive using 7-zip: https://www.7-zip.org/ 

(4) Step (3) should return the DataListGPre.mat file and the hpcont_data and spike_data directories. If you want to use the current filepath settings in the "generate_snips_loop.m" script, then within the outlier-waveform_detetion folder, do the following: 
-> create the following nested folder structure: 
GPi_input_data/G/Pre	
-> move the hpcont_data and spike_data folders into GPi_input_data/G/Pre
-> create a "GPi_datalists" folder
-> move the DataListGPre.mat file into GPi_datalists

(5) Run the "generate_snips_loop.m" script.
-> "subj" should be set to "G"
-> "mptp" should be set to "Pre"
-> This code aligns the spike waveforms for each sorted unit,
on a per-session basis
-> set writeData to true to write out the snip data that 
would be used for feature computation (already available
on Zenodo, in snip_output.tar.7z)
-> set writeFigs to true to save out figures of the 
aligned waveforms
