How to recreate spike waveform alignment
updated 5/5/24
-----------------------------------------
-> Note: This code was written in Matlab R2022a, and 
makes use of optional toolboxes provided by Mathworks.  
It is not guaranteed to work with earlier Matlab versions. 

(1) Relevant data from monkey G, pre-MPTP are made available 
in the Zenodo repository: 

-> Data to accompany the outlier-waveform-detection 
Github repository
-> DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.11077189

The data are limited to this monkey/MPTP combination due 
to the practical challenges involved in uploading large
files to Zenodo.  Data from the other three monkey/MPTP 
combinations are available upon request.

(2) To demonstrate waveform alignment, downlaod the following files from the Zenodo repository: 

-> GPi_datalists.tar.7z
-> G_Pre_spike_data.tar.7z
-> G_Pre_hpcont1.tar.7z
-> G_Pre_hpcont2.tar.7z
-> G_Pre_hpcont3.tar.7z
-> G_Pre_hpcont4.tar.7z

(3) The downloaded files can be decompressed using 7-zip: https://www.7-zip.org/.
Files can also be extracted from the .tar archive with 7-zip, or with tar on the command line.
Creation and placement of the files in specific folders will be useful for taking 
advantage of the default filepath settings in the Matlab scripts; see below.

(4) Unzipping/extracting the contents of GPi_datalists.tar.7z and of G_Pre_spike_data.tar.7z will return "GPi_datalists" and "GPi_input_data" folders, respectively, which can be placed in the same outlier-waveform-detection folder that houses this text file. 

(5) Below GPi_input_data, you will find the nested subfolder structure "G/Pre". Create a folder in "Pre" called "hpcont_data" (alongside the existing "spike_data" folder).  

(6) Decompression/extraction of each of the G_Pre_hpcont*.tar.7z files will reveal a set of .mat files.  These should be placed in the hpcont_data folder.

(5) Run the "generate_snips_loop.m" script.
-> "subj" should be set to "G"
-> "mptp" should be set to "Pre"
-> This code aligns the spike waveforms for each sorted unit,
on a per-session basis
-> set writeData to true to write out the snip data that 
would be used for feature computation (already available
on Zenodo, in snip_output.tar.7z)
-> set writeFigs to true to save out figures of the 
aligned waveforms
