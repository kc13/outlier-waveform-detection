[this repository is still in progress]

This repository shares Matlab code that identifies single units with spike waveforms that take on outlier feature values. 

To recreate the outlier detection performed on sets of GPi units obtained from two nonhuman primates (in healthy and 
parkinsonian states), follow two steps:
